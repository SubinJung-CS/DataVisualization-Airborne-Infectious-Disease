# Data Visualization of Airborne Infectious Disease

Visualization has become a tool both for the exploration of raw data and for the presentation of analysed data to end users. In this project, I represented my analysis of data about a medical emergency in a city to an end user who must make a rapid decision using the data. 

It was assumed that end user is a time critical decision maker, such as a gold command police officier, an army commander or a politician in a government COBR meeting. Based on my visualization, the end user will decide where to deploy limited tactical resources - medics and medical supplies. The key was to show predicted impact and level of uncertainty of that impact to make a decision. Also, it was considered that the decision makers will not understand statistical methods or mathematics. In addition, visualization has been made considering all possible situations such as print/fax and color blindness.

The data given are a set of outputs from a DSTL/PHE supercomputer simulation of an airborne infectious disease outbreak over Manchester. The dataset consists of followings:
- Longtitude and latitude
- A unique cell ID
- The population of the cell
- Four estimates of the number of infected people from each of the four simulation runs
- Uncertainty statistics per cell across the four runs: mean, variance, standard deviation, index of dispersion and coefficient of variation.

The figure below is the final visualization model using PowerBI and the interactive features are demonstrated here: https://youtu.be/2fIA__qbJR8 . For more details, please have a look at the uploaded report in the repository.
